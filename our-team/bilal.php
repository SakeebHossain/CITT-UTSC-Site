                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>Program/Year?</i>
                        <br/>

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> I’ve always been interested in current world issues, the problems in society and how we’re tackling them regardless of their fields of interest (economics, politics, science etc.). In addition to this, critiquing, debating, and arguing are things I enjoy. I strive to form my own opinions, uninfluenced by media bias and peer pressure. Given these interests of mine and as one of the co-founders of CITT, CITT UTSC was pretty much a home that didn’t exist, so, I strolled over to the Department of Student Life, and here we are.

                        <strong>A:</strong> Barbecue/Honey Barbecue chicken wings! If anyone’s looking to be part of the team, you know how to bribe me.

                        <strong>A:</strong> I love grabbing a snack/drink and binging my favourite TV show despite the fact that I know I’m going to regret it the very next day.

                        <strong>A:</strong> Teleportation without question. I can sleep in and still be on time for class!
