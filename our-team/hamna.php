                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Making my voice along with others voices heard has always been a strong passion of mine. Plus, given the opportunity to create platforms for student engagement on local issues as well as another chance to work with a lot of my friends and to make new friends, sparked my interest in becoming a part of CITT UTSC.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite food?</i>
                        <br/> 
                        <strong>A:</strong> Although it's really hard to decide as most of my favourite food dishes are from Indian/Pakistan Cuisine. My favourite food would be Pani Puri and Tandoori Chicken Biryani. A small fried shell with mixed chickpeas, yogourt, and tamarind sauce topped with spiced water that explodes in your mouth is beautiful. I can eat them non-stop. The fresh aroma of mixed rice with a layer of barbecue smoked Tandoori Chicken on top just enhances my day.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite hobby?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> My favourite hobby is to watch old and classic movies/shows and cooking. I love catching up on all old Indian Classics and cooking new dishes every time.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>If you can have any super power, what would it be?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Since, my favourite show was Danny Phantom, and I've always loved Danny’s transformations. I’ve always wanted to be like him where I would transform into a superhero who will defeat all types of evil. So, the superpower I’ve always dreamt of having is a combination between invisibility, flying, and understanding any form of language around the world. Maybe called standinvisiflying?!
