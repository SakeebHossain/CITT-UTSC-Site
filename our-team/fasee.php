                        <strong>A:</strong> I actually have a lot of experience regarding graphic designing as I have been involved with a lot of clubs as Marketing director and Graphic designer so I felt I can be a very good addition to the team of CITT UTSC. Besides that, the thing that attracted me the most was the general goal of this club concerning education and how getting different opinions from students through surveys can create a voice regarding different issues that students face in their University life. Not just that, this initiative has been recognized across many universities in Canada and its a good way collect diverse responses from different students across Canada.
