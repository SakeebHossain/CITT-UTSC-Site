                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> After skimming through a large amount of inspiring quotes from extremely successful people and friends, I finally came across one which describes what I value and what I see in CITT: “Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” So I got busy and joined CITT UTSC. CITT is more than just discussing key problems, it is about putting solutions to those problems on paper and taking action! Likeminded individuals have been joining CITT’s membership to heighten our impact on our community, so join our action team!
