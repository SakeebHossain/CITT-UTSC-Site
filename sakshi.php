                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>Program/Year?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Co-op Management, Year 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Aside from the great Management Clubs available at UTSC, I really wanted to "step out" and try something new that would contribute to expanding my network and social interactions. I sought to join CITT to not only meet new people but because my values matched with the clubs. As a part of CITT UTSC, I hope to have a positive experience and plan events that will change every student's experience.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite food?</i>
                        <br/> 
                        <strong>A:</strong> My favorite food is an Indian dish, called "Shahi Paneer". It is a dish that includes paneer (a type of cheese) covered in a rich heavy gravy. The taste, especially if eaten with "naan", is out of this world and I can die eating it!!

                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> One of my favorite hobbies is playing the piano. It allows me to express myself in many ways, no matter my mood!

                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> I wish I had the ability to understand everything at once. This would make achieving a 4.0 so much easier!
