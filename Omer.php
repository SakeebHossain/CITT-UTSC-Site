                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> The desire to tackle local issues in the community. I believe that there are already many organizations looking to tackle issues seen across the globe, and I think itâ€™s awesome that people are looking for ways to make the world a better place. But, I feel like we can do our part by looking at the specific issues that face our cities and communities and look to solve these issues through the critical viewpoints of the students of UTSC.
