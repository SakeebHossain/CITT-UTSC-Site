                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Co-op Management, Year 2.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Before coming to university, I had hoped that the university environment would be one of the best platforms that allow people to learn and cultivate a wide knowledge base. With this, people could make smart decisions regarding the problems that they face in their day to day lives instead of being ignorant and rash. However, only after coming to university did I realize that many issues were not being raised or even mentioned to the general populous, thus allowing students to remain oblivious about world issues. The main reason why I joined CITT was because CITT’s mission to showcase issues that were not being heard as well as raise general awareness on opinions that were being ignored would allow students to become clear on a multitude of issues, thus allowing them to make better and informed decisions. As this is something that I hoped for since before entering university, making this a reality is something that I look forward to this year.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite food?</i>
                        <br/> 
                        <strong>A:</strong> To be fair, I love all kinds of food and will eat anything. It’s at the point where I have been recently suspecting whether or not I have a black hole for a stomach. But if I was to name one delicacy that I could never have enough of, that would be wings, especially honey garlic wings. They are mouth wateringly good and will probably die one day if they ever had an all-you-can-eat-wings event at our campus.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite hobby?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> My favourite hobby is a tie between reading and archery. While I’m reading, I feel extremely relaxed and become entirely engrossed with the book at hand. I easily lose focus towards my surrounding and unless someone is yelling at me or physically shaking me, I probably wouldn’t respond to anyone if they had casually called me. With regards to archery not only does it help me focus my mind on only one thing, but it also helps me improve my hand eye coordination as well as help me become more spatially aware. And to this day, I’ve found nothing more satisfying than the sound of when my arrow hits the bulls eye.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>If you can have any super power, what would it be?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> If I had any super power, I’d want the ability to instantaneously copy any ability, technique, or power that I’ve seen or read, whether it’s in real life or through a book, a show etc. My reason for this is actually simple. This super power will definitely help me through any situation I will ever encounter in my life, and in all honesty, this power should be considered the biggest cheat code of life.
