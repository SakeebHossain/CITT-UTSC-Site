                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>Program/Year?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Co-op Management, Year 2.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What made you become part of CITT UTSC?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> Students, especially university students will soon be the vast majority of working adults that will shape and grow society. I believe it’s important for students to voice their opinions and work together to alleviate current issues and to also prevent future issues from occurring. Students are the future, we can create a meaningful impact with our minds and voices. This personal belief aligned with CITT’s mandate, of being a Think Tank and bringing others together to discuss certain issues in a safe environment. Thus, CITT was definitely something I wanted to contribute my skills to. Through this position, I hope to oversee amazing and valuable events for the UTSC student body and promote critical thinking and awareness of important, relevant issues.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite food?</i>
                        <br/> 
                        <strong>A:</strong> My favourite food would have to be matcha ice cream. In fact, anything with matcha in it makes me happy! I love how matcha can be bitter and drank as a refreshing tea while also being a sweet and unique dessert. No matter what form it is in, it has always been delicious to me.

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>What is your favourite hobby?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> My favourite hobby is playing the piano and clarinet. I’ve been playing the piano for over 13 years and the clarinet for over 9 years. I love music. Playing it, learning about it and performing in ensembles has always been so much fun to me. I’m currently studying to earn my teacher’s certificate in piano education because my ultimate goal in life is to mix my passion with my career aspirations so that I never will have to work a day in my life!

                        <strong>Q:</strong> <i>If you can have any super power, what would it be?</i>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> If I could have any super power it would be the power to read peoples’ minds because sometimes it is so hard to figure out what my friends and family are thinking about! With mind reading I could find out what I need to know right away and would avoid any beating around the bush. Even though it would be an invasion of privacy, it’s okay I assure you that I’m a trustworthy person who can keep a secret!
