                        <br/>
                        <strong>A:</strong> I have always been passionate about awareness of different topics that affect not only us as students but as Canadians as well. When I came across the opportunity to become part of CITT, I thought what better way to engage students and strike up a conversation about topics that matter!

                        <strong>A:</strong> This is a tough one! I think I'm going to have to say pizza and sushi, they're too good for me to pick just one!
